# What is this folder?
This is the `buildtools` folder which houses some custom tools used for building open source ports. For example, Super Mario Bros. Remastered at time of writing uses a custom build of `Godot 4.5.1.rc`. Godot 4.5's export templates use a later GLIBC than ArkOS, so custom Linux ARM export templates were built to accommodate.

You should only be wading around in this folder if you're a dev and/or know what you're doing. It isn't something the typical port enjoyer needs.

## Automated port builds

Ports with an open-source upstream can be built and updated automatically by the [`Build Ports`](../.github/workflows/build_ports.yml) GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow polls each registered upstream on a daily cron, builds any port whose upstream has moved since the last committed build, and commits the fresh payload back to the relevant `ports/released/...` directory — one commit per port so updates are visible per-port on the GitHub Pages site.

### Layout

Each automated port lives here under `buildtools/<id>/<id>/`. Files common to every port live at the `buildtools/` level; per-port recipes only contain what's actually port-specific.

```
buildtools/
  registry.json                       ← registry of automated ports
  build_port.sh                       ← shared driver (Docker build + retrieve)
  docker-setup.sh                     ← shared: builds per-port image, starts container
  Dockerfile.base                     ← shared: Ubuntu aarch64 + SDL2 dev deps + CMake
  <id>/
    <id>/
      .gitignore                      ← ignores build scratch; only src/ is tracked
      src/
        Dockerfile                    ← `FROM rhh-base` + port-specific apt deps
        build.txt                     ← clones upstream, builds, stages libs
        retrieve-products.txt         ← copies artifacts into the port payload dir
```

The inner `<id>/` is the staging dir the build writes into during a run (`sonicmania`, `Game.so`, `libs/*.so.*`, etc.). The `.gitignore` at that level ignores everything except `src/` — build outputs never get committed from there; they only get committed after being copied into `ports/released/...`.

`build_port.sh` builds the shared `rhh-base` image once per workflow run (Ubuntu focal + build-essential + SDL2 subsystem dev headers + newer CMake). Each port's Dockerfile then does `FROM rhh-base` and installs only its unique apt deps. Docker's layer cache makes subsequent ports in the same run near-instant.

A port group whose ports all need the **same** deps can drop a single `Dockerfile` at the group level (e.g. [`harbourmasters/Dockerfile`](harbourmasters/Dockerfile)) and omit the per-port `src/Dockerfile` entirely — `build_port.sh` falls back to the nearest ancestor `Dockerfile` when a port has none of its own. Groups whose ports need port-specific deps just keep a `src/Dockerfile` per port and hit that path unchanged.

### The registry

[`registry.json`](registry.json) lists every automated port. The workflow reads this file to know what to check and what to build. Each entry needs:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `port_dir` | Path to the build-scratch dir (e.g. `buildtools/ports/sonic/rsdkv5/rsdkv5`) |
| `target_dirs` | List of payload dirs to receive the build output. Usually one (e.g. `["ports/released/sonic-collection/sonic.mania/sonic.mania"]`). Multiple entries fan one build out to several ports — used when a single decomp produces a binary consumed by two or more port folders (e.g. RSDKv4 feeding both sonic.1 and sonic.2). |
| `upstream_repo` | GitHub `owner/repo` to poll for new commits |
| `track` | Optional. `"branch"` (default) = rebuild when `upstream_branch` HEAD moves. `"release"` = rebuild when a new release tag is published. Pick `release` for projects with a stable release cadence; `branch` for rolling-main decomp projects. |
| `upstream_branch` | Branch to track when `track` is `"branch"` (usually `main` or `master`). Ignored in release mode. |
| `commit_prefix` | Uppercase tag used in commit messages, e.g. `[RSDKV5] Update to abc1234` |
| `artifacts` | Files or directories to copy from `port_dir` into each `target_dirs` entry after a build |

### How upstream changes are detected

The first entry in `target_dirs` contains a committed `.upstream-sha` marker file with the upstream commit the current binaries were built from. Each run fetches upstream HEAD via the GitHub API and compares against that marker. Mismatch → build. Match → skip. When a build fans out to multiple target_dirs, all of them get the same marker written so they stay in lockstep.

This means you never need a "release" or version tag — the workflow tracks rolling `main`/`master` branches by commit SHA.

### Running the workflow

- **Scheduled**: daily cron at 04:30 UTC. Builds every registered port whose upstream has moved since the last committed SHA.
- **Manual**: `workflow_dispatch` with:
  - `port` — choice of `all` (every registered port) or a specific port id
  - `force-build` — if true, bypass the SHA check **and** skip committing. Outputs are uploaded as a workflow artifact (`force-build-outputs`) instead. Use this to smoke-test a build recipe before letting scheduled runs commit real changes.

If one port's build fails, subsequent ports still run. Failures are surfaced as job-level errors.

### Adding a new port

1. Drop the build recipe in `buildtools/<id>/<id>/src/`:
   - `Dockerfile` — starts with `FROM rhh-base` and installs only port-specific apt deps. Optional when the port's group ships a shared `Dockerfile` one or more levels up (e.g. `buildtools/ports/harbourmasters/Dockerfile`); `build_port.sh` uses the nearest ancestor `Dockerfile` when `src/` has none.
   - `build.txt` — clones upstream, builds, stages libs into `build/libs/`
   - `retrieve-products.txt` — copies artifacts from the build tree into the port dir
2. Create `buildtools/<id>/<id>/.gitignore` with exactly this content, which keeps the inner `<id>/` dir tracked only for `src/` and lets the rest serve as build scratch:
   ```
   # Build-time scratch — only src/ is source, everything else is output from
   # retrieve-products.txt and should not be tracked.
   /*
   !/.gitignore
   !/src/
   ```
3. Add an entry to [`registry.json`](registry.json). Use `target_dirs` (list) even when there's only one target.
4. Seed `ports/released/<category>/<port>/.upstream-sha` (on each target_dir) with a known-older upstream commit SHA so the next run actually builds and validates the pipeline end-to-end.
5. Run the workflow with `port: <id>` and `force-build: true`. Download the `force-build-outputs` artifact, sideload on a device, confirm it runs.
6. If the artifact works, run again with `force-build: false` to let it commit the real payload. From then on, the cron handles it.

### Why we don't ship libSDL2-2.0.so.0

Every supported device provides `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` at runtime, often with device-specific patches (GL backend, audio, touchscreen). The build recipes still build SDL 2.32 from source — that's so other bundled libs (libzip, tinyxml2, etc.) link against a modern SDL2 at build time — but the resulting `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` is **not** staged into the port's `libs/`. Shipping ours via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` would override the device's patched copy and could regress things that currently work.

Note: `libSDL2_net-2.0.so.0` is different — devices don't reliably provide it, so it IS shipped by ports that need it (e.g. SoH's anchor/network-play support).

### Why staging uses explicit `cp -L`

In each port's `build.txt`, the staging block looks like:

```bash
cp -L /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libogg.so.0 ./libs/libogg.so.0
```

The `-L` follows symlinks so the destination is a real file with the right name, and the source and destination are named explicitly. This is deliberate:

- **Filename must match the binary's `DT_NEEDED` entry exactly.** The dynamic loader searches `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for a file *named* (say) `libogg.so.0`. If the shipped file is named differently — e.g. `libogg.so.0.8.4` because `cp` copied the versioned real file, or just `libogg.so` because `cp` dereferenced a dev symlink — the loader silently skips it and falls through to the system library. The bundled lib never loads.
- **Wildcards + `find -delete` hacks are fragile.** Earlier versions used patterns like `cp .../libogg.so.[0-9]* libs/` followed by `find -delete`. That breaks when `cp` follows multiple symlinks at once, creates broken links, or when the delete pattern overmatches. Several hm64-builder ports were silently shipping unused or misnamed libs for a long time because of this.

Each `build.txt` also has a verification step that runs `readelf -d <binary>` and fails the build if any staged lib isn't in `NEEDED`, or any expected `NEEDED` lib is missing from `libs/`. This turns a silent regression (shipping wrong files) into a loud build failure.
